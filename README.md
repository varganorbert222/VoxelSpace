# VoxelSpace

The original algorithm comes from [here](https://github.com/s-macke/VoxelSpace). Please look around there first.
I also have to thank the [repository](https://github.com/hanatos/sioux), where I found the C program I used to extract the maps from the game.

You can try my implementation here [VoxelSpace Demo](https://varganorbert222.github.io/VoxelSpace/index.html).
Take a look around my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEOzw2b5SALP72s9TMlW3ug), where I implemented the algorithm in Unity.
